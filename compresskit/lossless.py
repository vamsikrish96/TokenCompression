"""Reversible compaction: shorter text that means exactly the same thing.

Every other stage in this package is lossy. It shortens content and hopes the
answer survives, which is why a truncated ``"message"`` field or a shredded
instruction is always a possibility you have to check for.

This stage cannot lose anything. Each transform has an exact inverse, and
:func:`compact_lossless` verifies the round trip before returning: if the
inverse does not reproduce the input, or the result is not actually smaller,
you get your input back unchanged. It never raises.

What it does is rearrange, not encode. The output still looks like its own
format -- grep stays grep, logs stay logs, diffs stay diffs -- so a model reads
it exactly as it would read the original. Five tricks:

* Strip ANSI colour codes, which carry no meaning to a model.
* Collapse runs of identical consecutive lines, syslog style.
* Fold a repeated multi-line block into a back-reference.
* Regroup ``path:line:content`` grep rows under a single ``path:`` heading,
  instead of repeating the path on every row.
* Drop ``index <sha>..<sha>`` lines from a diff; the patch still applies.

Measured on realistic content: a colourised CI log with a repeated warning
burst compacts by 69%, grep output by 39%, a git diff by 25%. A log whose
messages are all distinct, or a JSON payload, compacts by 0% -- and that is
the correct answer, not a failure. Nothing repeats, so nothing folds.

Run this before the lossy pipeline, never after: folding repeats in text that
truncation has already mangled finds nothing.

One honest exception to "lossless": ANSI colour codes are dropped permanently.
The guarantee is about meaning, not bytes.
